 --- The LORENTZ TRANSFORMER ---


This is a user manual for the program LorentzTransformer.

LorentzTransformer is a visualisation tool to help you understand special relativity and Lorentz transformations. When you start the program you will see an empty 1+1 dimensional Universe, over some simple controls.

This program visualizes the physics, but does not attempt to explain it. For an explanation of what is going on, ask internet or a physicist.

Note: This program is not finished. This manual describes how things are supposed to work, and NOT necessary how they are now.



the UNIVERSE

This is a 1+1 dimensional universe, which means that we have one time dimension and one space dimension. Time dimension is up, and the space dimension is to the side. 

The faint yellow cross in the background, is a the light cone for the centre of the Universe. The centre is used as the origin, for all transformation, thus, the light cone for this point will always stays in place.



the CONTROLS

Use the drawing options, "Lines", "Points", "Remove" and "Clear", to add or remove points and lines to your Universe. 

Lines are color coded as follows:

    Time-like: Green
    Light-like: Yellow
    Space-like: Read
    
Hold the SHIFT key while drawing lines, if you want to draw light-like lines (i.e. precisely diagonal), or precisely horizontal or vertical lines.
    
Use the slide-bar to preform Lorentz transformation on your Universe. While you are holding the slide-bar, a text will appear, telling you the speed difference corresponding to the Lorenz transform you are currently making.

Click right mouse button to interrupt line drawing or Lorentz transformation.



the HIDDEN MENU

In the top left corner is a hidden menu, that will appear if you hover the mouse over it.

"Help" opens this document, if you have not moved it, or something.

"Save" saves your current session.

"Load" let you load a previous session.

Sessions are saved as .lor files in the "Saves" folder. You can share your saved sessions with others, by copying the .lor file in to their "saves" folder.

The "Saves" folder must be in the same location on you computer as the LorentzTransrormer. If the folder does not exit, a new one will be created.



some LESS IMPORTANT INFORMATION

The save files are rely just text files written in json. But it is cool to have ones own extension. If you want, you can try specifying a new session directly as text, and then try to run it. I leave as an exercise to figure out the details of how to do this.



a WARNING

If you edit this document, it might cease to be helpful.
